The project report of airlines reservation systems is attached. This report covers the development of a C++ program designed to manage airline reservations. The system integrates with an SQL database to handle flight data, including booking seats and displaying available flights. Users can enter a flight number to make a reservation, and if a seat is unavailable, they will receive a "sorry" message. The Airline Reservation System allows users to reserve seats on flights. The system involves checking flight details, handling errors, updating seat counts, and displaying available flights and seats.
